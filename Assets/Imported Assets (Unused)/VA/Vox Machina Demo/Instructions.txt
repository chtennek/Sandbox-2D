Attatch the SentenceAssembler script to an object with an audio source. Enter the number of sentences you would like in the 
Custom Sentence Lists field, and then fill those arrays with the audio clips you would like it to play. In order
to play a specific sentence, call the GetSentence(#) function, where "#" is the index of the sentence in 
CustomSentenceLists[]. 
EXAMPLE: To play the first sentence in CustomSentenceLists[] you would use GetSentence(0).

Pitch
-------
The pitch options will change the pitch of each individual word in a sentence depending on the values in the 
Pitch Bend Range field. 
None: This will leave the pitch unaffected.

Random Pitch: This will coose a random value inside of the pitch bend range for each word in a sentence.

Ascending: The first word of the sentence will start at the lowest value of pitch bend range and step up on 
	each successive word.

Descending: The first word of the sentence will start at the highest value of pitch bend range and step down 
	on each successive word.

Question
---------
When Question Ask is toggled on, the last word in a sentence will be pitched up, imitating a questioning tone.
The inflection option indicates how much the pitch is altered, a larger number means a greater change.
